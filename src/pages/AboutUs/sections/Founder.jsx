        <p>There are several roadblocks from residency, self employment and more that makes housing feel impossible. Many are spending years saving for a deposit and even then are having to take on large debt burdens to get on the property ladder.</p>
        <p>I founded Carmel Homes on belief that there should be a better way that will enable millions of households to buy their first home earlier.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to help provide housing to all.</p>
